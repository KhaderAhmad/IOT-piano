required hardware:
a speaker (connected to an amplifier).
an esp32 board.
wires.

steps:
connect to following pins in the amplifier:
VIN: Connect to the 3.3V or 5V pin on the ESP32 (depending on your amplifier's voltage requirements, typically 5V).
GND: Connect to a GND pin on the ESP32.
GAIN: If your amplifier has a gain pin, you can leave it unconnected or follow the amplifierâ€™s datasheet for connection options (sometimes it can be connected to GND or VCC to set different gain levels).
DIN (Data In): Connect to the ESP32 I2S data output pin (usually GPIO 22 or GPIO 23).
BCLK (Bit Clock): Connect to the ESP32 I2S bit clock pin (usually GPIO 26).
LRC (Left/Right Clock): Connect to the ESP32 I2S left/right clock pin (usually GPIO 25).

connect the board to a power source, upload the sketch and enjoy.
